# üìä Statistics and Data Analysis Projects (R)

### üåü Repository Overview

This repository showcases hands-on projects and assignments completed for a university course on **Statistics and Data Analysis**. The focus is on the practical application of core statistical principles‚Äîfrom basic probability and data visualization to advanced topics like regression, time-series analysis, and formal hypothesis testing‚Äîusing the **R programming language**.

The projects demonstrate strong proficiency in data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical inference, and creating high-quality visualizations using the `ggplot2` framework.

### üìÇ Repository Structure

The projects are organized into separate folders, each containing the R code (Jupyter Notebook or R scripts), necessary data files, and a dedicated `README.md` detailing the objectives and key findings of that specific assignment.

| Folder | Focus Area | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`HW1-Dice-Simulation-and-Sampling`** | Probability & LLN | Practical demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers through dice simulation and setting `seed()` for reproducibility. |
| **`HW2-Range-Normalization`** | Data Preprocessing | Implementation of Min-Max Scaling and critical conceptual analysis of its drawbacks, focusing on outlier sensitivity and loss of interpretability. |
| **`HW3-Regression-Time-Series-and-T-Test`** | Advanced Analysis | Comprehensive project involving time-series trend analysis, linear regression modeling, and formal one-sample T-testing for hypothesis inference. |

### üöÄ Getting Started

To explore the projects, simply navigate into any of the sub-folders and refer to the dedicated `README.md` file for project-specific details, execution steps, and dependencies.

All projects require the **R programming language** and a standard R environment (RStudio or Jupyter Notebook with R Kernel). Key libraries like `ggplot2` and `dplyr` are used extensively.
